# Website-alterations
homework 2

The assignment called for refactoring a "company's" existing webpage. This included making the website more accesible by using semantic 
elements all while keeping the same design. 
I did this by first changing the semantics of the html file and adding alt tags to increase accessibilty 
Then i organized and adjusted the css file accordingly so that the changes would not affect the website display.
I also optimized the images to be more user-friendly
